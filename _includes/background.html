      I am currently working with 
      <a href="https://vasileiostzoumas.com">Prof. Vasileios Tzoumas </a> 
      on robust outlier detection for computer vision applications.
      We are developing a method to detect and remove outliers from sensor data without any prior knowledge
      of noise distribution and threshold. The goal is to achieve long term autonomity via resilient perception.
