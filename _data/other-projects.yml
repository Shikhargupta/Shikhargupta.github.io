  description: Final team project for Machine Learning course at UMich. 
  We explored and improved upon DeepMind's work on training an agent using human preferences.
  I was responsible to experiment with training of the reward function. I was 
  able to replace a neural network (as originally stated in the paper) with a less complex
  Gaussian Process for simpler environments like CartPole and MovingDot.

  description: A collection of Machine Learning algorithms written from scratch. 
  I created this Github repository to help beginners in ML get an understanding of 
  the working of some of the popular algorithms. I intend this work to be ever 
  growing with new algorithms and models being added in the future.

  description: In order to understand the complete pipeline of data science
  I played around with the famous Ames Housing dataset. I visualised and pre-processed
  the data and applied regression techniques to predict house prices. I eventually ended
  up in top 20% of the leaderboard.

  description: As a part of my bachelor's thesis I developed a Python library for Spiking Neural Network with simplified equations. 
  Later, along with a batchmate I designed an asynchronous hardware accelerator for the library on FPGA. 
  The python library has 600+ stars and 200+ forks on Github.
